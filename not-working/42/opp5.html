        <h2 id = "a">Structuring a good paragraph</h2>
        <p id = "c">A topic sentence is the most important sentence in a paragraph. The function of the topic sentence is to help organise the paragraph by clearly stating the central idea and preparing the reader for what the paragraph will be about. A topic sentence is usually (but not always) presented at the beginning of the paragraph.

            The other sentences in a paragraph are supporting sentences. They add information to and elaborate on the information in the topic sentence, offering examples, explanations, facts, and more detailed information. It is very important that the supporting sentences all pull in the same direction and stay on topic. Using transitional words, such as 'next', 'similarly', 'moreover', and similar words, will help build the unity and coherence that the paragraph needs, because such words show that the supporting sentences build on each other and clearly relate to the topic sentence.
            
            A paragraph should also have a concluding sentence. This kind of sentence serves two purposes: it concludes the paragraph, so that the reader fully understands the meaning of the paragraph, and it also allows for a smooth transition between the concluding sentence of one paragraph and the topic sentence of the next. Good transitions highlight the key information that connects one paragraph to the next and help create a logical flow between ideas.

        <p id="d">Let's take a look at an example of a body paragraph where these elements are in place. This is a paragraph taken from a student research paper about poverty and social conditions in the United Kingdom. The first sentence is the topic sentence, and it gives the reader information about what this paragraph will be about:
