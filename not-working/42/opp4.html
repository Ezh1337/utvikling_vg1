        <p>A woman is running along the beach, her long dark hair flying behind her as she moves. The sun is setting in the background, casting a warm orange glow over the shoreline and reflecting off of the water. She's wearing a black tank top and shorts, with white sneakers on her feet. Her arms are outstretched as if to embrace the beauty of nature around her. In front of her lies an expanse of sand that stretches for miles, dotted here and there with rocks and shells that have been washed up by waves from far away oceans. Further down the beach stands a mountain range, its peaks reaching high into the sky above. The air smells salty from all of this ocean life surrounding us; it's peaceful yet invigorating at once. As our gaze follows this woman running along this beautiful landscape we can't help but feel inspired by how free she looks in such an open space - like nothing can stop her!</p>
